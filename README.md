# 🩺 Symptom Checker Gone Rogue – Help Fix It!  

## 🚑 What's the Problem?  
I built a small **Symptom Checker** app, but it’s running into some serious issues! The brainless AI needs some help to get its act together (backend fix, please!). Here’s what’s broken:

- **Bad Symptom Matching** – It's spitting out weird or unreliable results.  
- **Messy Dataset** – The dataset feels off, like the weightings are all wrong or some conditions are missing.  
- **Backend Instability** – Random errors, crashes, and just bad vibes all around.  
- **User Input Issues** – It often misreads inputs or doesn’t respond correctly.

## Step 1: Install Node.js and npm

Before you can run the app, you need to make sure Node.js and npm are installed. Here’s how to get them:

### 1.1 Download Node.js:
- Go to the [Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and download the **LTS (Long Term Support)** version. This is the stable version that works great for most projects.

### 1.2 Install Node.js:
- Once downloaded, run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions. You’ll also get **npm** (Node Package Manager) automatically installed.

### 1.3 Verify Installation:
- Open your terminal and check if Node.js and npm are installed correctly by running:
  ```bash
  node -v
  npm -v
  ```
- If you see version numbers, you’re good to go! ✅

## Step 2: Get Your Project Ready 🚧

### 2.1 Clone or Download the Repo:
- First, get the project onto your machine by cloning the repo or downloading the project folder.

### 2.2 Navigate to Your Project Directory:
- Open your terminal and change to the project directory:
  ```bash
  cd path/to/your/project
  ```

### 2.3 Install Project Dependencies:
- You’re almost there! To install all the necessary dependencies, run:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
- This command will install all the packages listed in the `package.json` file.

## Step 3: Run the Symptom Checker 🏃‍♀️

### 3.1 Start the Development Server:
- Let’s get your app running! Use the following command to start the development server:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

### 3.2 View Your App:
- Your app should open automatically in the browser. If not, go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in action!

## Step 4: Start Debugging and Fixing 🛠️

Now that your app is running, it’s time to tackle those issues. Here are a few places to start:

- **Symptom Matching** – Investigate the logic that matches user inputs to conditions. Look for issues in the algorithm or dataset.
- **Dataset Fixes** – The dataset might need cleaning up. Check if the conditions and their corresponding weights are correct.
- **Backend Stability** – Look into backend-related crashes or random errors. Is there a particular pattern or issue causing it to break?
- **User Input** – Test edge cases and ensure the app handles them well. Misreads could indicate issues in input validation.
